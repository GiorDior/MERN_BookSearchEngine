# Book Search Engine

Most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.

## MERN Challenge: Book Search Engine

This project involves refactoring a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app utilizes the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the backend.

### To fulfill the Challenge, youâ€™ll need to do the following:

- Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
- Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.
- Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
- Deploy the application to Render.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up a MongoDB database and update the connection string in the `.env` file.
4. Run the server using `npm start`.
5. Navigate to the client directory and run the React app using `npm start`.
6. You can now access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

Happy coding!
